You probably feel like you have no options if you’re looking for cash loans without a bank account requirement. After all, most loan providers want you to have a bank account of some sort to show you have a regular income to help repay your debt.

If you don’t have a bank account, you aren’t alone. Approximately 7.1 million Americans have no bank account for various reasons. Some have no access to a local bank. Others have financial issues that keep them from maintaining the minimum balance some banks require.

Whatever your reasoning for not having a bank account, several loan options are still at your disposal, but they can be expensive. Consider our alternatives for a more affordable loan option — they may be easier to obtain than you think.
