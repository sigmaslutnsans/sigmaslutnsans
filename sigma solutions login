Cash Advance Loans: Also known as payday loans, these financial products typically don’t require a credit check or bank account for approval. Instead, you will only need to prove that you have sufficient income to repay the debt in between 14 and 30 days. If approved, you can leave shortly after with cash in your pocket. While this may seem like an easy option for obtaining a short term loan, there are definitely pitfalls to cash advance loans. An average cash advance loan comes with a 400% interest rate. You can expect your finance charges to equal approximately $15 for every $100 you borrow — but that is only if you repay your loan on time. If you can not satisfy the debt through one lump-sum payment, the lender will roll the loan over into a new agreement. This loan will have a higher interest rate — sometimes as high as 1,400% — and even more penalty fees. You will continue to roll over your loan until you pay the debt off. This is how some consumers have racked up as much as $50,000 in debt from a $2,500 loan. Consider payday loans a last-resort emergency loan.
